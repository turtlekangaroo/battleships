# Battleships
This is my version of the classic Battleship game.

### How to run the server?
Open a command line and change directory into the battleships directory and execute the server using `node server.js`.

### How to connect to the server?
Once the server is running you should be able to connect to it through your browser by navigating to `127.0.0.1:80`.

Note: If you aren't running the server on your local machine, you obviously have to enter the server's IP address instead of `127.0.0.1:80`.
